youth language
  rating                      : 6
  details                     : The text contains some elements of youth language, such as "Bro" and "Jo", as well as the abbreviation "Liebe" to "Liebe". However, it does not contain any emojis or other common features of youth language. The use of Latin phrases like "Divide et impera" and "equus" (which is a Latin term for horse) suggests that the text may be written by someone who is familiar with classical languages, which is not typically associated with youth language.
understandability
  rating                      : 2
  details                     : The text uses many complex words and phrases, such as "Divide et impera," "Liebe ist immer wie Feuer und Flamme," and "Equus." The use of Latin and a made-up word for horse would likely be difficult for 13-year-olds to understand. Additionally, the text contains many grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make it challenging to follow.
conciseness
  rating                      : 3
  details                     : The text is not very concise and describes sayings.
