youth language
  rating                      : 1
  details                     : The text does not contain any elements of youth language or emojis. It is a passage from Herman Melville's "Moby Dick," written in formal, old-fashioned English. The author uses complex sentence structures and vocabulary that is not typical for informal communication among young people. There are no signs of abbreviations, emoticons, or slang expressions that are often used in youth language. Therefore, I would rate the text as a 1 on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means that no youth language and no emojis are used.
understandability
  rating                      : 5
  details                     : The text is an excerpt from Moby Dick by Herman Melville. While the language used is quite beautiful and descriptive, it can be challenging for 13-year-olds to understand due to its antiquated vocabulary and complex sentence structures. The text might require a higher level of patience and willingness to reread and look up unfamiliar words for a young reader. Nonetheless, the vivid descriptions and engaging storyline could still capture their interest if they persevere.
conciseness
  rating                      : 6
  details                     : The text is not concise enough, as it contains many descriptive parts that could be shortened or removed without losing the essence of the content. However, the text does have its interesting moments, especially when describing the human fascination with the sea and waters. The writing style is unique, but might not appeal to everyone, which lowers the interest score a bit.

youth language
  rating                      : 1
  details                     : The text does not contain any elements of youth language or emojis. The language used in this text is formal and professional, which is typical for legislative or policy documents. Youth language often includes abbreviations, slang, and informal expressions that are not appropriate for formal documents such as this one. Therefore, the rating for this text is 1, indicating that it does not contain any youth language or emojis.
understandability
  rating                      : 2
  details                     : The text is not very understandable for 13-year-olds. The text uses complex language and concepts that may be difficult for young people to grasp. Additionally, the text assumes some prior knowledge of artificial intelligence and its related policies, which may further hinder understanding for a younger audience. It would be beneficial to simplify the language, break down complex ideas into simpler terms, and provide more context and explanations for key concepts to make it more accessible to 13-year-olds.
conciseness
  rating                      : 3
  details                     : The text is not concise, interesting, or succinct. It contains unnecessary repetition and could be condensed significantly. The information provided in the first paragraphs could be summarized into one or two sentences. The proposal lacks a clear, engaging introduction that would draw the reader in and make them want to continue reading. Overall, the text is overly formal and legalistic, making it difficult for the average reader to understand and engage with.
